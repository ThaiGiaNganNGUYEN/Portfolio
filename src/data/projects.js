    solution: "SOLUTION", 
    solution_content: "A systematic methodology is applied to each target to ensure consistent results. The process begins with network reconnaissance using tools like netdiscover and nmap to identify live hosts and open service ports. This is followed by service enumeration, where web directories are brute-forced and CMS versions are scanned for known vulnerabilities. Initial footholds are often established through command injection or weak credentials, followed by local privilege escalation techniques - such as exploiting misconfigured cron jobs, SUID binaries, or systemd services - to gain root or administrator privileges." , 
    tech: "TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE", 
    tech_content: "The testing lab is built on a virtual environment utilizing Host-only networks to simulate isolated internal LANs.

    challenge: "CHALLENGE", 
    challenge_content: "The challenge is to identify and exploit a security flaw where a web application processes state-changing requests (fund transfers) without verifying the request's origin. In the simulation, the application accepts requests via simple links, allowing an attacker to forge a transfer request that the user's browser automatically executes using their active session credentials.", 
    solution: "SOLUTION", 
    solution_content: "The solution implements the Synchronizer Token Pattern. A unique, cryptographically strong CSRF token is generated for the user's session (getCSRFToken in common.php). This token must be included in any state-changing request (transfer.php). The server verifies that the submitted token matches the session token before processing the transaction, effectively blocking unauthorized requests from external sites." , 
    tech: "TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE", 
    tech_content: "The application is built with PHP for server-side logic and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It uses PHP Sessions to manage user authentication and store account data (balance, transaction history) in memory. The project is structured into Vuln and Secure directories to provide a side-by-side code comparison. The secure implementation utilizes hash_hmac with SHA-256 to generate secure tokens.", 
    feature: "KEY FEATURES", 
    feature_content: "• Vulnerable & Secure Modes: Direct comparison of code vulnerable to CSRF vs. secured code.\n• Banking Simulation: Features a dashboard for viewing balance and transaction history.\n• Attack Scenario: Includes an evil.php page ('Lucky Draw') that acts as the attacker's trap.\n• Session Management: Handles user login (isLoggedIn) and maintains state across pages.\n• Account Reset: specific functionality to restore the simulation environment.", 
    design: "USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN", 
    design_content: "The user interface mimics a simple online banking portal with a clean, functional layout using Bootstrap. The attack vector is designed as a gamified 'Lucky Draw' page with a spinning wheel animation, demonstrating how social engineering is used to entice users into clicking malicious links that trigger background requests.", 
    perf: "PERFORMANCE", 
    perf_content: "The application is lightweight, running on a standard PHP built-in server. By utilizing session-based storage instead of a persistent database for this simulation, it achieves near-instantaneous response times for transactions and page loads, focusing purely on the logic of the security vulnerability.", 
    result: "OUTCOMES", 
    result_content: "In the vulnerable version, interacting with the 'Lucky Draw' page silently drains the user's funds by triggering transfer.php. In the secure version, the same action is blocked; the server detects the missing or invalid token and triggers a security alert ('CSRF Attack Detected!'), preventing the unauthorized fund transfer.", 
    future: "FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS", 
    future_content: "• Database Integration: Move from session storage to a persistent MySQL/SQLite database.\n• SameSite Cookies: Implement SameSite=Strict cookie attributes as an additional defense layer.\n• Double Submit Cookies: Add examples of stateless CSRF protection.\n• AJAX Protection: Extend token validation to asynchronous JavaScript requests.", 
    conclusion: "This project provides a practical demonstration of CSRF vulnerabilities and their mitigation. By comparing the vulnerable and secure implementations, it highlights the critical importance of validating request intent using anti-CSRF tokens in web application development.",
